# Zeroth AI Whitepaper

Zeroth is a reasoning-first, developer-friendly AI framework designed to simulate how humans think—structured, logical, and memory-based. Unlike large language models that rely heavily on token prediction, Zeroth builds reasoning chains and stores persistent knowledge, delivering explainability, modularity, and practical intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To create AI systems that think before they speak, act with context, and reason like humans.

## 🎯 Mission

Build a lightweight, offline-friendly, explainable AI engine that is developer-first and aligns more with human cognition than probabilistic predictions.

## 💡 Core Values

- **Transparency**: Every decision is traceable.
- **Modularity**: Each agent serves a single purpose.
- **Trust-by-Design**: Human approval before saving unknowns.
- **Explainability**: Clear, human-readable reasoning.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Run where GPUs can’t.
## ⚙️ Key Features
- Modular agent architecture (Planner, Memory, Reasoner, Explainer, Clarifier, Feedback, LLM and Ingestor)
- LLM-first planning with spaCy fallback
- Dual LLM modes for factual or creative reasoning
- Graph memory with synonym search and fuzzy matching
- Document ingestion with fact validation
- Chain-of-thought reasoning traces
- Works offline with minimal LLM use

## 🧠 Zeroth in Action

Example workflow:
1. Planner breaks a goal like “Plan Mars mission” into subtasks.
2. Memory checks what’s already known.
3. ClarifierAgent asks follow‑up questions if a subtask is unclear.
4. Reasoner makes deductions from known facts with chain‑of‑thought prompts.
5. FeedbackAgent validates any new facts suggested by the LLM.
6. Explainer compiles a full trace of how Zeroth reached the answer.

## 🆚 Zeroth vs Traditional LLMs

| Feature               | Zeroth AI                         | Traditional LLMs              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Reasoning Clarity     | Transparent reasoning chain       | Black-box answers             |
| Memory                | Structured graph memory           | Context window only           |
| Resource Requirement  | Lightweight (Neo4j, LLM fallback) | GPU-heavy                     |
| Adaptability          | High (custom docs/PDF ingestion)  | Fine-tuning needed            |
| Fact Storage          | Persistent, queryable             | Ephemeral                     |
| Explainability        | Yes (via ExplainerAgent)          | No                            |

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Forward Path

- **Scalability**: GraphDB indexing & expiration policies in development.
- **Accuracy**: Fact validation loop to enhance LLM-derived knowledge.
- **Speed**: Local cache and reduced LLM call optimization underway.

## 🌟 Why Zeroth Matters

Zeroth does not aim to replace LLMs, but to balance them. It empowers developers with tools that prioritize **clarity over guesswork**, **logic over prediction**, and **trust over magic**.
