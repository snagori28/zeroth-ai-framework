# zeroth-ai-framework
Zeroth is a reasoning-first, developer-friendly AI framework designed to simulate how humans thinkâ€”structured, logical, and memory-based. Unlike large language models that rely heavily on token prediction, Zeroth builds reasoning chains and stores persistent knowledge, delivering explainability, modularity, and practical intelligence.
